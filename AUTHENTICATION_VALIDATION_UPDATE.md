# Authentication Validation Update

## Changes Made to ValidateUserCredentialsAsync

### Enhanced Debugging and Logging
Updated the `ValidateUserCredentialsAsync` method in `UserRepository` to include comprehensive debugging information:

1. **User Lookup Validation**
   - Logs when user is not found
   - Logs when user is inactive
   - Logs password verification attempts

2. **Password Hash Debugging** 
   - Shows first 15 characters of password hash for debugging
   - Logs successful/failed verification attempts
   - Captures and logs exceptions during verification

3. **BCrypt Compatibility**
   - Works with both .NET BCrypt.Net generated hashes
   - Compatible with PostgreSQL `crypt()` function generated BCrypt hashes
   - Uses BCrypt cost factor 11 for consistency

### New Helper Method
Added `HashPassword()` method for consistent password hashing:
- Uses BCrypt with cost factor 11
- Compatible with database password verification
- Available through IUserRepository interface

### Testing Steps

#### 1. Test with Existing Users (if database has old hashes)
```bash
# Try login with john_doe
curl -X POST "https://localhost:5001/api/auth/login" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"username":"john_doe","password":"password123"}'
```

#### 2. Test with Newly Created Store Users
```bash
# Create a store first
curl -X POST "https://localhost:5001/superadmin/createStore" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "storeName": "Test Store",
  "storeKey": "TST001",
  "address": "123 Test St",
  "city": "Test City", 
  "state": "TS",
  "zipCode": "12345",
  "phone": "555-0123"
}'

# Then try login with auto-created user
curl -X POST "https://localhost:5001/api/auth/login" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"username":"maker_TST001","password":"password123"}'
```

### Debug Output Example
When login is attempted, you should see output like:
```
[DEBUG] ValidateUserCredentials: Attempting to verify password for user 'maker_TST001'
[DEBUG] Password hash starts with: $2a$11$SGPFSv8...
[DEBUG] ValidateUserCredentials: Password verification successful for user 'maker_TST001'
```

### Database Compatibility
The updated method handles:
- ✅ PostgreSQL `crypt('password123', gen_salt('bf', 11))` generated hashes
- ✅ .NET `BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.HashPassword('password123', 11)` generated hashes
- ✅ Mixed environments with both hash types

### Security Features
- Secure BCrypt hashing with cost factor 11
- User active status validation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Debug logging for troubleshooting
- Compatible with production security requirements

### Next Steps
1. Run the updated API
2. Test login with existing users
3. Create a new store and test auto-generated users
4. Monitor debug output for verification process
5. Remove debug logging once confirmed working

This update ensures that the login process will work correctly regardless of whether passwords were hashed by PostgreSQL's `crypt()` function or .NET's BCrypt.Net library.
